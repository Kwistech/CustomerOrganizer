Customer Organizer v.1.0 - Johnathon Kwisses (Kwistech)

Customer Organizer is a program for Python 3 that stores customer information in a logical way.

Upon First Run:
===============
A new customer directory must be created. To do this, enter: 'new customer'

Give the program the information it asks and it will create a directory with the
customers name in the customer_files directory. In this directory will be two files
(ex. customer_name.json, customer_name_log.txt).

The .json file is the file in which the customers information will be stored.
The .txt file is a log of all the changes you have made to the .json file.

Menu Commands:
